						<p>I am graduating from The University of Utah with a BS in Computer Science. I
							love
							the outdoors and enjoy spending time with my family. I have a passion for programming and
							really
							enjoy working in the backend. I have some experience working in the frontend as well, but
							the
							backend is what I enjoy most. I have experience with many programming languages and many
							tools
							that are used in the industry. Through my internship I have learned many new skills and I am
							always looking to learn more. For the past year I have been working on a Software
							Development
							team and have loved every minute of it. I enjoy developing software and I also enjoy
							maintaining
							the software and databases that our company currently has. I have learned a lot about
							databases,
							SSIS, scheduling jobs, and many other topics that have made me a more well rounded Software
							Engineer.</p>

						<p>For the past few years I have been attending the University of Utah and enjoyed every bit of
							it. I have reached the finish
							line and am graduating with my degree in Computer Science. Throughout my time here I have
							learned quite a bit about software engineering learning
							plenty of languages and how to solve difficult problems in efficient ways. I was able to be
							a teaching assistant for a few courses
							the past few years which allowed me to get more involved with the students and helped me
							really hone my CS knowledge. Through hard work in school
							I have been able to work as an intern with the Air Force where I was able to create an
							application to communicate with various systems on a
							helicopter using the JREAP protocol. Outside of school and work I enjoy playing video games,
							programming and the outdoors. A project I worked
							on that I am quite proud of is Parle, an application that relayed SMS messages between users
							translating those messages into their preferred language.
							It also allowed users to send money to each other with their respective currency using
							Galileo's API. This actually won my group (with fellow capstone member Archie Menon) 3rd
							place
							at HackTheU, the largest Hackathon in Utah. I look forward to future endeavors as well as
							learning new and exciting things in the industry.</p>

						<p>I am pursuing a combined BS/MS degree in Computer Science and will be starting my
							master’s next semester. Along with Computer Science, I also have a minor in Mathematics.
							Currently, I am a teaching assistant under Professor Erin Parker for CS 2420 Introduction to
							Algorithms and Data Structures. In 2019, my team (including fellow capstone member <a
								href="#Ruben">
								Ruben
								Arellano
							</a>) won 3rd at HackTheU, Utah’s largest hackathon. Our project was called Parlé, and it
							was a service that sends and receives SMS messages between users, automatically translating
							messages into the preferred language of recipients. It also had mobile banking features for
							sending and receiving money through SMS. One of my interests is in statistics whether it’s
							election polling or Vegas sports predictions. Another interest I have is in compilers and
							operating systems, and I hopefully will be going deeper in these areas during my master’s.
							Outside of school and CS, I dabble in volleyball and am a huge fan of the Utah Jazz.
