					<h3><a id="installation" href="#installation">Installation</a></h3>
				</u>
				<p>DistanSing is meant to be run without any installation required. The one caveat to this is that the
					ASIO driver "ASIO4ALL"
					must be installed. Download ASIO
					<strong><a href="downloads/ASIO4ALL_2_14_English.exe">HERE</a></strong>
				</p>
				<p><strong>(Make sure you also install the ASIO Offline Settings!)</strong></p>

				<u>
					<h3><a id="howASIO" href="#howASIO">How do I edit ASIO settings?</a></h3>
				</u>
				<p>When you installed ASIO4ALL you should have checked the option to install the "ASIO4ALL Offline
					Settings". (See <a href="#installation">here)</a></p>
				<p>Open these settings by searching for them in your windows start menu.</p>
				<img src="images/FAQ/offline_settings.png" alt="Windows offline settings search"
					data-position="center center" />
				<p>Opening this will bring up the settings.</p>
				<img src="images/FAQ/offline_settings_basic.PNG" alt="basic offline settings"
					data-position="center center" />
				<p>Clicking the "wrench" icon will bring up the advanced settings. (Most Useful)</p>
				<img src="images/FAQ/offline_settings_advanced.png" alt="advanced offline settings"
					data-position="center center" />
				<p>Here is an example of what the advanced setting might look like. Notice how it lists all of the
					possible audio cards you have. In my case, I have:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>HD webcam - Has a built in microphone</li>

					<li>High Definition Audio Device - My default Windows 10 sound card</li>
					<li>
						Nahimic mirroring device - An add on sound card I have.
					</li>
					<li>HyperX Quadcast - My condenser microphone</li>

					<li>Logitech G330 Headset - A USB Headset</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The ones which have a '+' or '-' next to them are devices which support both input and output. </p>
				<p>The "Power" button indicates which device is selected, and also which sub-devices are selected within
					the selected device.</p>
				<p>A "Subdevice" indicates different input devices or capabilities, for most devices there will be one
					output and one input device.</p>
				<p>For DistanSing to work properly, only one master device should be chosen, and then only one output
					and one input device chosen before DistanSing is started.</p>
				<img src="images/FAQ/offline_settings_advanced_selected.png"
					alt="advanced offline settings selection indicated" data-position="center center" />
				<p>In my case, my Logitech G330 Is selected (The power button is lit up for the entire device). And its
					respective input and output devices are selected as well.
					If I wanted to select my HyperX Quadcast condenser microphone, I would <strong>click</strong> the
					power button for that device as well as the respective input/output subdevices. I would also
					<strong>deselect</strong>
					the logitech headset and its subdevices. As shown below:

					<h3><a id="audio" href="#audio">I cannot hear anything/others cannot hear me.</a></h3>
				</u>
				<p>The primary reason for audio/microphone not working is due to ASIO not being configured properly.
					ASIO is
					required for the low-latency
					to work properly. Follow the instructions under <em><strong><a href="#howASIO">How do I edit ASIO
								settings?</a></strong></em> to ensure
					that your ASIO settings are correctly set up.

					<h3><a id="whatASIO" href="#whatASIO">What is ASIO?</a></h3>
				</u>
				<p><a href="https://www.steinberg.net/en/company/technologies.html" target="_blank">ASIO</a> (Audio
					Stream Input/Output)
					is a protocol allowing for ultra-fast communication
					between a software application and a computer's sound card. It was developed by Steinberg in 1997.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Audio Stream I/O API addresses
					the areas of efficient audio processing, high data throughput, synchronization, low latency and
					extensibility on the audio hardware side.
					The interface is not bound to any fixed number of input and output channels (of course these numbers
					are limited by the processing power
					and data throughput of the computer system itself).
					It puts no limitation on the sample rate (32 kHz to 96 kHz or higher), sample format (16, 24, 32 bit
					or 32/64 bit floating point formats).
					It takes advantage of todayâ€™s computer architectures for high data throughput (PCI, FireWire, USB).
					It supports
					sophisticated hardware solutions for additional audio processing but it remains simple in comparison
					to other approaches.</p>

				<u>
					<h3><a id="whyASIO" href="#whyASIO">Why is ASIO necessary?</a></h3>
				</u>
				<p>Through our <a
						href="https://www.highfidelity.com/blog/how-much-latency-can-live-musicians-tolerate-da8e2ebe587a"
						target="_blank">research</a>, we have found
					that the maximum tolerable latency (the delay for sound to travel from sender to receiver) is
					about 20 milliseconds.</p>
				<p>Without ASIO, the absolute lowest latency we could achieve was somewhere between 100 - 150
					milliseconds. This is not a problem
					whatsoever in traditional conference call/audio streaming use cases. However, with our goal being
					realtime audio, this was unacceptable.
				</p>
				<p>We discovered ASIO as a method for achieving low-latency. Our initial tests were promising, giving us
					an optimistic 5 - 10 ms minimum latency!</p>
				<p>The one problem with ASIO is that it completely hijacks the sound card, and thus presents undefined
					behavior when other programs wish to playback audio or access the microphone. This was an acceptable
					tradeoff for us.
